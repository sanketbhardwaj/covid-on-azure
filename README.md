azurefunctions_covid19
Built an automated system using Azure Functions and Twilio.
Time interval, country, Sender and Receiver number needs to be specified and the user will receive a given countryâ€™s status such as
New Confirmed
Total Confirmed
New Deaths
Total Deaths
New Recovered
Total Recovered
on the given phone number via SMS (Microsoft Azure Functions, Twilio, Python, JSON, VSCode)

Detailed Explanation
I will explain the working of the project here.

Tools and Tech needed:

Microsoft Azure

VSCode

Twilio

Covid-19 Database JSON

So first, there's a Python code.

The code needs a few parameters from the user:

 Time Interval
 Twilio Account ID
 Twilio Account Auth Passkey
 Sender Number
 Receiver Number
After these details, the user can request these parameters from Covid-19 Database JSON:

New Confirmed
Total Confirmed
New Deaths
Total Deaths
New Recovered
Total Recovered
An SMS on phone will be received on given Time Interval with the specified parameters about the latest data in the Covid-19 database of that country.

Example of an SMS:

As of today there are xxx New Confirmed cases, xxx Total Confirmed, xxx New Deaths, xxx New Recovered, and xxx Total Recovered in country_name

Sample: Response: { "Countries": [ { "Country": "Afghanistan", "NewConfirmed": 5, "TotalConfirmed": 16, "NewDeaths": 0, "TotalDeaths": 0, "NewRecovered": 0, "TotalRecovered": 0 }, .. "Date": "2020-03-16T21:10:53.86852587Z" }
